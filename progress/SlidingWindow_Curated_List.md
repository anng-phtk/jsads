**Phase 0** – Warm-up & Fixed Window (get the muscle memory)	
Master fixed-size window + basic counters
| #| LC num | title|
|:---|:---|:---|
|	1.	|	 643.	|	 Maximum Average Subarray I|	  
|	2.	|	 1456.	|	 Maximum Number of Vowels in a Substring of Given Length|	  
|	3.	|	 1343.	|	 Number of Subarrays of Size K and Average ≥ Threshold|	  
|	4.	|	 2090.	|	 K Radius Subarray Averages|	  
|	5.	|	 1052.	|	 Grumpy Bookstore Owner|	  
|	6.	|	 1423.	|	 Maximum Points You Can Obtain from Cards|	  
|	7.	|	 1652.	|	 Defuse the Bomb"	|

All fixed size k → you learn the sliding template without thinking about expansion/contraction|	

Phase 1 – Classic Variable Window (the 4 immortal ones + direct extensions)	
Internalize the “while condition → shrink left” pattern
| #| LC num | title|
|:---|:---|:---|
|   8.	|	 3.	    |	 Longest Substring Without Repeating Characters|  
|	9.	|	 424.	|	 Longest Repeating Character Replacement|	  
|	10.	|	 76.	|	 Minimum Window Substring (solve twice)  
|	11.	|	 567.	|	 Permutation in String|	  
|	12.	|	 438.	|	 Find All Anagrams in a String|	  
|	13.	|	 340.	|	 Longest Substring with At Most K Distinct Characters|	  
|	14.	|	 159.	|	 Longest Substring with At Most Two Distinct Characters|	  
|	15.	|	 904.	|	 Fruit Into Baskets"	|	

These are the archetypes.Everything else is a remix of these
2 – “At Most / Exactly / At Least” family. Master the three canonical tricks
| #| LC num | title|
|:---|:---|:---|
|	16.	|	 1004.	|	 Max Consecutive Ones III|	  
|	17.	|	 487.	|	 Max Consecutive Ones II|	  
|	18.	|	 1493.	|	 Longest Subarray of 1’s After Deleting One Element|	  
|	19.	|	 209.	|	 Minimum Size Subarray Sum|	  
|	20.	|	 713.	|	 Subarray Product Less Than K|	  
|	21.	|	 2958.	|	 Length of Longest Subarray With at Most K Frequency|	  
|	22.	|	 1838.	|	 Frequency of the Most Frequent Element|	  
|	23.	|	 1438.	|	 Longest Continuous Subarray With Absolute Diff ≤ Limit|	  
|	24.	|	 992.	|	 Subarrays with K Different Integers (Hard but worth it early)"


“At most k bad things” and “exactly k” via subtraction are the two biggest unlocks
3 – Clever / Weird Windows (the ones that feel unfair at first). Expand your pattern library
| #| LC num | title|
|:---|:---|:---|
|	25.	|	 1234.	|	 Replace the Substring for Balanced String|	  
|	26.	|	 2024.	|	 Maximize the Confusion of an Exam|	  
|	27.	|	 1658.	|	 Minimum Operations to Reduce X to Zero|	  
|	28.	|	 1695.	|	 Maximum Erasure Value|	  
|	29.	|	 2134.	|	 Minimum Swaps to Group All 1’s Together II|	  
|	30.	|	 1151.	|	 Minimum Swaps to Group All 1’s Together|	  
|	31.	|	 1208.	|	 Get Equal Substrings Within Budget|	  
|	32.	|	 2271.	|	 Maximum White Tiles Covered by a Carpet|	  
|	33.	|	 2461.	|	 Maximum Sum of Distinct Subarrays With Length K|	  
|	34.	|	 2962.	|	 Count Subarrays Where Max Element Appears at Least K Times"	|	

These look impossible until you realize they’re still sliding window in disguise
4 – The Rest – Mop-up + Contest-style (do in any order inside the phase)

Cement everything + speed	
| #| LC num | title|
|:---|:---|:---|
| 35–116.	|	 All remaining 82 problems from your list (I recommend sorting by acceptance rate descending inside this phase)	|	

At this point you will crush all of them in ≤30 min each
